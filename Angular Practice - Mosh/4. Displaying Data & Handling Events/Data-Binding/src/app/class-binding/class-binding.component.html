<!-- 
* Class Binding

1. We use Class binding whenever we need to dynamically change (add or remove) the class of DOM element.
2. We use syntax [class.classname] = "boolean variable"
3. If the value is true then the target class is added to the DOM element, else not.
4. Class Binding is also a variation of Property Binding.
