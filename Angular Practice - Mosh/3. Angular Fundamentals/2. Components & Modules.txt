* Components

1. Components are the basic building blocks of Angular Apps.

2. A Component encapsulates the "Data", "Template (View)" and the "Logic" (Logic related only view / presentation).

3. A Website may have only a single component for the entire application.

4. Or may it may be divided into different components such as
    - Navigation Bar Component
    - Side Bar Component
    - Content Page Component so on.

    - Course Header Component
    - Course Description Component
    - Table of Contents Component
    - Course Rating Component
    - Comment Section Component
    - Footer Component

- Each of these components are individual components that can be reused in the same application or entirely in separate application.

6. Angular is based on Component based Architecture. Each component in Angular Loosely Coupled (completely independent).

7. The Components in Angular are tree structured, with root being the App Component.
    - This App Component has further sub trees of user defined components such as Nav Bar Component, Side Bar Component and Content Page Components.



* Modules

1. Modules in Angular are the containers for related components.

2. When an application grows with many components, we can group the similar components into Modules.

3. An Simple application can have only one Module.

4. Complex Application can have many modules, with each module focussing a particular aspect.
    - Course Module
