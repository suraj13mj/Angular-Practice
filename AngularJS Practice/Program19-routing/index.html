<!-- 
    1. AngularJS is mainly used for building Single Page applications.
    2. Here we will have a main layout of the html, in which we inject different views (i.e HTML Pages) based on the URL requested.
    3. We require separate Angular routing module for injecting differenct views into the WebPage.
