<h1> Employees of Indian Premier League </h1>

<ul>
    <li ng-repeat = "emp in Employee"> 
        {{ emp.Name }}                                  
    </li>
</ul>


<!-- 
    1. Here when we change emp.Name to emp.ID because of browser caching, it is not automatically reflected.
    2. Since we are requesting the same web api, but only changing it in view, the browser assumes it to same as previous cache
    3. Thus it shows the cached html

    -> This problem is solved when we use the IIS Server in Visual Studio.
