<!-- 
    1. ng-include directive is used to embed an HTML page into another HTML page 
    2. This technique is extremely useful when we want to reuse a specific view in multiple pages

    3. The value of ng-include directive can be the name of HTML page
    <div ng-include = "'layout.html'"></div>

    4. Or it can be property on the $scope object that points to HTML page
        $scope.HTML_Layout = "layout.html"

        <div ng-include = "HTML_Layout"></div>

    5. In order for ng-include to work we need to serve the this webpage i.e index.html
        - In the Project folder open cmd line
        - npm install http-server -g
        - > http-server . -o
        - Open the link served at particular port no
