/*

1. It is mandatory to have template (external html or inline html) in a component.
    - We can omit selector and style, but not template.
    - Through routing there is another method to add selectors.

2. String Interpolation or Property binding is used access data present in the component from the view (template).

3. Event Binding is used react to User events (click, keyup) etc that occur in the View. The code for handling these events is written within the component.

4. Directives are instructions in the DOM.
    - Components are also directives but with a template. 
    - Where we place the selector of a component we are directing the Angular to replace it with the content of the template and the business logic of that component.

    'background-color' : 'red',
